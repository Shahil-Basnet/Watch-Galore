                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            As the world moves forward technology keeps on evolving. Watches are no exception. With the rise of
                            smartwatches and the integration of technology into traditional watches, the industry is witnessing a
                            significant shift. The impact of technology on watches is multifaceted, with both positive and negative
                            effects.

                        <h3 style="text-align:center;color: black;margin: 40px;font-size: 28px">The positive impact</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            Modern smartwatches, they offer functionality beyond time telling. They offer various functions such as 
                            fitness tracking, smart phone integration, health tracking and more. This has made watches more than just
                            a fashion accessory. Not only functionality but environmentally friendly watches are also gaining popularity
                            among consumers and producers. Eco-friendly materials are being used to make watches, even the boxes they are packaged 
                            in are made from recycled materials.<br>
                            Smartwatches are getting well "smarter" with AI features, voice assistants, and health tracking. Some can spot irregular heartbeats, measure oxygen levels, and
                            track stress using special sensors. They also have fall detection and emergency SOS options, which are especially helpful for seniors or people with health issues.
                            <br><br>
                            With continuous advancements in technology, sustainability, and user experience, smartwatches are shaping
                             the future of wearable devices, making them indispensable tools for health, productivity, and convenience.

                        <h3 style="text-align:center;color: black;margin: 40px;font-size: 28px">The negative impact</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            While it all seems good, there are some negative impacts of technology on watches. The most significant one is the
                            loss of traditional craftsmanship. With the rise of smartwatches, the demand for traditional watches has decreased.
                            This has led to a decline in the number of skilled watchmakers along with tradition. The technology has advanced but 
                            the price has also increased. This has made watches (apart from luxury watches) less affordable to the masses.
                            Although sustainable materials are being used to produce watches, the production process still has a significant impact on the environment.
                            The mass production of watches require a lot of energy and resources which is not sustainable in the long run.<br><br>
                            Finally, the pressure to always innovate in the tech industry has created a culture where older smartwatch models quickly become outdated, leading people to replace them often and create more waste.
                             This constant demand for new gadgets could go against efforts to be more sustainable and consume responsibly in the long run.

                    <div class="sub1">
                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            As technology continues to shape the watch industry, brands face a dual challenge: embracing
                            innovation while staying true to their heritage. The blending of tradition with technology is not
                            just reshaping the watches themselves but also the experiences they deliver. In this dynamic
                            landscape, the future of watches lies not just in keeping time but in keeping pace with the ever-
                            evolving expectations of consumers.
